    "### Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "Ans: Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name. In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number. Arrays allocate memory in contiguous memory locations for all its elements. Hence there is no chance of extra memory being allocated in case of arrays. This avoids memory overflow or shortage of memory in arrays."

    "### Q2. What are some of the array package's limitations ?\n",
    "Ans: The number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance. An array is a static structure (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified. The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and the shifting operation is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allocating more memory than the requirement leads to wastage of memory space and less allocation of memory also leads to a problem"

It only works as a dummy statement.\n",

    "Ans: : Yes, it is possible that we can include a string of fixed length in numpy array. The dtype of any numpy array containing string values is the maximum length of any string present in the array.Once set, it will only be able to store new string having length not more than the maximum length at the time of the creation. If we try to reassign some another string value having length greater than the maximum length of the existing elements, it simply discards all the values beyond the maximum length accept upto those values which are under the limit."
